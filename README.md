# Backend_with_NodeJS

Hello and welcome to my repos :)
You will find here an example about how to create a basic backend with NodeJS
There are a lot of things basics so you will need to read more ;)
Remember that you need aldo to read to understand.

There is something particular in this repo about the connection with the DB.
It is just for testing and for an example. The connection to the DB
you need to create environment variables in order TO HIDE the credentials
and to not expose them in any public repository as this one.

Thank you so much for reading and for request any improvements :)

ECZ!
